# Paper files

This directory contains the research paper, figures, tables, and all other material necessary to produce the research article.
Figures should go in a `figures/` subdirectory, data (for inline R chunks) should go in a `data/` subdirectory, and LaTeX tables, if any, should go in a `tables/` subdirectory.
